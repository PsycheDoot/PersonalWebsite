        <p>This is the first iteration of lightup glasses. These were hastily put together with parts laying around.</p>

        <p>I used standard 5mm LEDs, which looked funny and required a decent amount of power. Also notice the wiring mess -- all of LEDs are individually wired with a common ground.</p>

        <p>The power supply was a simple hobby AAA battery holder mounted on the side of the glasses. It means that the right side of the glasses were heavier and sagged on my head.</p>

        <p>Here you can see the 16 pin decade counter and the 8 pin timer IC. The 555 timer chip's output wired directly into the decade counter's clock line. The decade counter's ten stages are wired to the different LEDs.</p>
